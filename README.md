# Time-series-forecasting

Time series forecasting is a process where a model is built to predict the future values based on previously observed values. It focuses on comparing values of a single time series or multiple dependent time series at different points in time. In this workshop, a model is built to predict the future GRP (Gross Rating Point) based on the previous GRP. To implement the same, 4 different time series methods were used to build models, which are, Decomposition, Exponential smoothing, ARIMA and Time series regression.
